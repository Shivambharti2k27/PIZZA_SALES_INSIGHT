# 🍕 Pizza Sales Analysis: SQL & Power BI Project

1. **📌 Project Overview**
1. The goal of this project is to analyze pizza sales data to gain insights into business performance and identify key trends.
2. The project is divided into two main objectives: KPI Analysis and Chart Visualization.
3. It utilizes SQL for data extraction and Power BI for interactive dashboard creation.


2. **🎯 KPI Requirements**
1. **Total Revenue**: The sum of the total price of all pizza orders.
2. **Average Order Value**: The average amount spent per order, calculated as: `Total Revenue / Total Orders`.
3. **Total Pizzas Sold**: The sum of the quantities of all pizzas sold.
4. **Total Orders**: The total number of unique orders placed.
5. **Average Pizzas per Order**: The average number of pizzas sold per order, calculated as: `Total Pizzas Sold / Total Orders`.


3. **📊 Chart Visualizations**
1. **Daily Trend for Total Orders**: A bar chart showing daily fluctuations and patterns in order volumes.
2. **Monthly Trend for Total Orders**: A line chart highlighting peak months or periods of high order activity.
3. **Percentage of Sales by Pizza Category**: A pie chart showing sales distribution across categories like Classic, Veggie, Supreme, and Chicken.
4. **Percentage of Sales by Pizza Size**: A pie chart showing customer preferences by pizza size (e.g., S, M, L, XL, XXL).
5. **Total Pizzas Sold by Pizza Category**: A funnel chart comparing category-wise sales performance.
6. **Top 5 Best Sellers**: Identifying the most popular pizza options based on Revenue, Quantity, and Orders.
7. **Bottom 5 Best Sellers**: Identifying underperforming pizza options based on Revenue, Quantity, and Orders.


4. **🛠 Tools & Technologies Used**
1. **SQL**: For data extraction and transformation.
2. **Power BI**: For data visualization and dashboard creation.
3. **Dataset**: Transactional data containing fields like `pizza_name`, `pizza_category`, `pizza_size`, `order_date`, and `total_price`.


5. **📈 Project Outcome**
1. Developed an interactive dashboard to track KPIs and visualize sales trends.
2. Identified top-selling and low-performing products to optimize menu offerings.
3. Provided insights into customer preferences for size and category to aid inventory planning.
4. Enabled data-driven decision-making for marketing promotions based on peak periods.


6. **📂 How to Use**
1. **Import Data**: Load the pizza sales dataset into SQL Server.
2. **Run SQL Queries**: Use the scripts provided in `SQLQuery3.sql` to prepare and validate the data.
3. **Visualize**: Load the processed data into Power BI to interact with the dashboard and explore insights.
